# PseudoContact

[PseudoContact](https://t.me/pseudocontactbot) is a simple program which helps you to keep your contacts clean in your
phone. Save them before deleting, and if they try to reach you out, you can easily see who are they.

## Why shouldn't you use Notes?

You are free to use it obviously, but I find plain notes quite *painful* to use. You don't need to worry about back-ups
if you use [PseudoContact](https://t.me/pseudocontactbot).

## Wouldn't be a mobile application more useful?

It would. The mobile application's advantage would be showing the name of the caller immediately.
